Introduction
===================

This IAMReX repo extends the capability of original `IAMR <https://amrex-fluids.github.io/IAMR/>`_ codes, aiming at simulating the multiphase incompressible flows and fluid structure interaction problems on both CPUs and GPUs with/without subcycling. The Navier-Stokes euqations are solved on an adaptive semi-staggered grid using the projection method. The gas-liquid interface is captured using the level set (LS) method. The fluid-solid interface is resolved using the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method (IBM). The particle-wall as well as the particle-particle collisions are also captured by the adaptive collision time model (ACTM).


Features
------------------

Key software and algorithmic features of IAMR include:

* LS method and reinitialization schemes

* Multidirect forcing Immersed Boundary Method

* Particle Collision Algorithms with Discrete Element Method
